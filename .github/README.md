# E-Bank System

This Project is primarily based on the implementation of the different C  
standard library functions of the file I/O operations. These functions were used  
to create a ".txt" file database where user data were stored and retrieved at  
desired times. 

The effective storage and retrieval of user data as well as the implementation  
of other core logical concepts were used to create a simple and smart E-Bank  
system. A _User Sign-In Authentication System_ was also implemented for security  
purposes.

## Preferred Compilers

* gcc
* clang
