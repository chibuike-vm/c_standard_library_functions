# User Sign-In Authentication System Using File I/O Operations

This Project is primarily based on the implementation of the different C  
standard library functions of the file I/O operations which was used to create a  
".txt" file database which was very instrumental in the effective implementation  
of the User Sign-In Authentication System. The project was inspired by the usual  
login authentication processes of websites.

## Preferred Compilers

* gcc
* clang
